An application that integrates data from txt files, xml files, and a database. The application can retrieve data from one file type and export it to another file type. Additionally, filters have been added to the application. Two of these filters allow displaying the number of products with a specific filter, while the third filter displays a list of filtered products. The application also includes buttons for adding, editing, and deleting records in the database. Both the filters and buttons utilize a second server-side application (serverDataIntegration - https://github.com/jakubsuchanowski/serwerDataIntegration.git) responsible for the logic of the selected functionalities.
